# Pandas Challenge

This repository contains homework assignment where we use Panda  dataframes to analyze district wide standardized test scores of students.

We performed calculations to create key metrics for district and schools such as total number of schools and students, total budget of schools and per student budget,average scores for math and reading for each school and overall passing rates.

We also sorted high and low performing schools and analyzed school performances based on school spending,school size and school type.
